# **LorePaint - Collaborative Mapping Made Simple**  

LorePaint is a Spring Boot application that enables seamless location management and collaborative editing on interactive maps. It features real-time updates, role-based access control, and interactive tools powered by **WebSockets** for smooth teamwork.  

### Core Features  
- **WebSocket-Powered Collaboration:** Enables real-time cursor tracking and live updates, ensuring users stay synchronized during map edits.  
- **Modular Architecture:** The project is split into Repositories, Services and Controllers realizing MVCS architecture for modularity.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Repositories ensure fast and reliable database operations using Spring Data JPA.
- **Thorough Testing Suite:** JUnit and Mockito tests validate critical workflows, from location updates to WebSocket events.  

### Why It Stands Out  
- üåç **Real-Time Teamwork:** Live collaboration features, including cursor tracking and role-based map editing, for intuitive user interaction.
- üõ†Ô∏è Built for Impact: A robust, real-world project that combines collaboration, live updates, and efficient data management.
- üöÄ Stand Out from the Crowd: A unique opportunity to demonstrate your ability to build scalable, interactive platforms from scratch.
